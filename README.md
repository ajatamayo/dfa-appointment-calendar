# Why the need for this?

I found that I really hated how you can only see available timeslots for a single date when booking appointments over at https://www.passport.gov.ph.

# What does this do?

This app will show you all available timeslots in a month.

# How do you use this?

1. Select a passport appointment site.
2. Find your chosen date.
3. Go over at https://www.passport.gov.ph/appointment and start your appointment.

# Note

- Available timeslots show at least 1 available slot. If you're making a group appointment, there might not be enough slots when you're on the official website.

# Disclaimer

I will not be responsible for missed appointments.
